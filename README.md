This project makes use of the state-of-art machine learning and computer vision algorithm to recognize hand gestures and voice commands, which works smoothly without any additional hardware requirments. It leverages models such as CNN implemented by MediaPipe running on top of pybind11.
It consists of two modules one which requires hand glove and another without hand glove.
Currently it works on Windows platform.
